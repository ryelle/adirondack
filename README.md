==========

This repo uses a src & build structure- all development happens in the src folder, and is then built via grunt into the build folder. (This is intentionally similar to WordPress core)

To run this theme from github (as opposed to me giving you a zip):

1. Clone this repo into your themes folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `grunt build` to create the build folder.
4. Activate the theme in the WP admin.
